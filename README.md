# Assessing Privacy Risks in Synthetic Data: Membership Inference Attacks on CT-GAN and DP-CTGAN Models

Data, one of the most demanding topics in the 21st century, is
an essential component and represents fundamental units of
potential knowledge, serving as a reflection or representation
of the real world. However, as the demand for this component
rises, the threat of preserving its privacy also increases.
Sharing data while preserving privacy is important, specifically
for fields dealing with sensitive data. This leads us to
synthetic data generation as a method for preserving privacy.
Synthetic data aims to preserve the distribution of the data
while hiding all the personal aspects of it. The raw data does
not need to be shared, and we can rely on the generated data.
GAN is one method that allows us to generate high-utility
synthetic data. In this study, we have tried to explore knowledge
about GAN models such as CT-GAN and DP-CTGAN
and generate synthetic data by CT-GAN introducing differential
privacy into it and observe the results of the degree
of deviation from original data.The membership inference
attack is a famous privacy attack that works on GAN models
by training shadow discriminator models and using them as
white box networks. Hence, we plan to evaluate membership
inference attacks on DPCTGAN and CTGAN and compare
the results through privacy preservation metrics.
